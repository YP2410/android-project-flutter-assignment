Dry questions:

1) The class that is used to implement the controller pattern is SnappingSheetController.
the controller allows the developer to control the following features:
currentPosition, currentSnappingPosition and currentlySnapping, with this functions:
snapToPosition, stopCurrentSnapping, setSnappingSheetPosition, currentPosition,
currentSnappingPosition, currentlySnapping, isAttached.

2) The paramater that controls this behaviour is snappingCurve.

3)  -advantage of InkWell over GestureDetector: InkWell has a Material Design
ripple effect when you touch it.
That gives the user a clear visual response to his touch.

-advantage of GestureDetector over InkWell:
InkWell supports only the Tap and Press events,
but the GestureDetector supports in addition other gestures like Drag, Pan and more.# android-project-flutter-assignment
